whatsapp-history-migrator
=========================

Are you a WhatsApp user with contacts in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or Esp√≠rito Santo states? Are you tired of the duplicated histories after all SP/RJ/ES numbers got an extra 9 before them? This tool will merge your old and new history files for each contact (eg, 551198765432 and 5511998765432)

=========================
HOW TO:

1) Backup WhatsApp history. To do so, go to Menu, Settings, Chat settings, Backup conversations.

2) Move msgstore*.db.crypt files from your phone (Android: sdcard/WhatsApp/Databases / iOS: /data/data/com.whatsapp/databases) to whatsapp-history-migrator directory.

3) Make sure you have the following packages installed: python, sqlite3, openssl

3) Run in your Linux or Mac OS terminal:
$ ./migrate_all_dbs.sh
This command will decrypt the history files, change the database to merge the history files and encrypt the files again.

4) Move the generated msgstore*db.crypt files back to your phone, replacing the old ones.

=========================
KNOWN ISSUES:

1) The only way I found to make WhatsApp load the migrated conversations was to uninstall WhatsApp just before step 4, and reinstalling it again after copying the files. WhatsApp will find the backuped files when it's reinstalled and it will ask you to recover them. If you find a smarter way, please contact me.
